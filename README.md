# Attempt at tracking a football game using computer vision

Done with the help of datasets on <a href="https://universe.roboflow.com/">robofolow</a> 

Model used was Efficient Det, it uses the same backbone as Efficient Net but adds a Bi-directional feature pyramid network to help in multi-scale feature fusion.
The reason for using EfficentDet is that it's a single-shot detector.

Chelsea Vs Man City game dataset was the only one available at the time. 

### Pending : Use the United game clip to create a dataset using Roboflow and then do the same
